The platform provides a Document Chatting feature, allowing users to interact with PDFs like study materials and receive AI-generated answers. It includes an AI-based Mock Interview system that analyzes responses, evaluates confidence and body language, and generates an interview performance report. Additionally, a Flashcard System enables quick revision of key concepts, while an Aptitude Practice Module helps users improve problem-solving skills. The platform generates resume-based interview questions and offers personalized feedback. Developed as a full-stack application using Next.js for the frontend and Node.js for the backend, it ensures a seamless, scalable, and user-friendly experience. The AI-driven analytics and recommendations help students identify areas for improvement, making the platform an all-in-one placement preparation.
